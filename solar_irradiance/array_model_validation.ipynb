    "In this notebook, we compare (retroactively) predicted vs actual power for FSGP 2024 using our simplistic Hardware Array Model.\n",

    "We use historical irradiance data provided by open-meteo as the ground truth for irradiance values, and telemetry current and voltage data as a ground truth for received electrical power. Note that both of these reference points have some inaccuracy: historical irradiance data is imperfect and not perfectly localized, and our array current sensors are known to somewhat inaccurate (though I do not know exactly in what way this is the case).\n",
