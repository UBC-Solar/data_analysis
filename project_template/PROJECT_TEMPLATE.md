# Project Template

This `project_template` folder is designed to be copy-pasted and adapted for every new UBC Solar Race Strategy data analysis project.

---

As with any template, use it as you see fit. **Feel free to remove unnecessary directories**.
The structure is in place to help guide new projects and to maintain consistency within this code repository.

However, **all new data analysis projects must**:



1. **Be completed in a new, standalone folder.**

If your work depends on the results of another project and the new project is still clearly distinct, either re-derive the values or add the required data to the new project's `/data` folder. Be sure to document where any data comes from.

2. **Use a project-specific [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) environment to manage dependencies**

// TODO: Add guide for UV

3. **Include documentation**

Documentation is required so that anyone can understand and reproduce your work. For Jupyter data analysis projects, writing out your process and thoughts in markdown is a simple and effective way to document your work. Be sure to include **your name**, **the date** and the **project name**.
