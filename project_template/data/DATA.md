# Data

Use this folder to store any **project-specific** data such as `.csv`,
`.npy`, `.npz`, or `.pkl` files.

Ensure that large files (>50MB) are being tracked by Git LFS (Large File Storage),
so that the repository does not grow unnecessarily.

To list files under Git LFS, run:

```
git lfs ls-files
```
